# Super Bowl data analysis using Python (DataCamp)

### Project Description:
Whether or not you like football, the **Super Bowl** is a spectacle. There's drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy in the games themselves. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes riding **giant mechanical tigers** or **leaping from the roof of the stadium**. And in this project, we try to find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. We answered questions like:
* What are the most extreme game outcomes?
* How does the game affect television viewership?
* How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
* Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

### Libraries used:
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn 

### Methodology:
* Importing and cleaning data
* Data manipulation
* Data visualization

### Outcomes:
In this notebook, we loaded, cleaned, then explored **Super Bowl game, television, and halftime** show data. We visualized the **distributions of combined points**, **point differences**, and **halftime show performances** using **histograms**. We used **line plots** to see how **ad cost increases lagged behind viewership increases**. And we discovered that **blowouts** do appear to lead to a **drop in viewers**.
